Main idea:
  Game consists of battles.
  Each battle is a chat with 1 leader and N players. 
  Leader's task is to choose one of them and each kekker wants to be chosen. 
  Winning improves your game state (eg. rating, game currency) and losing worsens it.
  Round time is limited. (min/max)

Possible features:
  1) Two game modes
       Regular chat
       Leader asks M questions; players answer; leader chooses best answer for each; a guy with most best answers wins
  2) Rating
       Winning increases it
       Losing decreases
       Leader's rating doesn't change
  3) Experience (winner gets more/everebody gets the same amount)
  4) Game currency (gold)
       Fixed battle entrance fee for players and for leader(?)
       Bets (???)
  5) Achievments
    Things that give you exp and gold
    You can get them multiple times, but first one is the most valuable
    Examples: 
      Win 2 girls 
      Win round within 10 seconds after lower bound
      Win with only one message
